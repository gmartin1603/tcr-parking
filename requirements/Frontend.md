## Frontend

The frontend will be a web application that will be used by customers to reserve a parking spot and order food. The frontend will also be used by parking lot attendants to see the parking spots that are reserved and the parking spots that are available. The frontend will also be used by concession stand workers to see the food orders that need to be prepared.
